# TrainTime

TrainTime is an application made to set and display multiple Train schedules. The user can set the train info such as
the name, destination, arrival time, and frequency. The app will then display the information, including the next estimated time of
arrival and how many minutes away the next train is, to any user with access to the site.  
This is accomplished by sending the data to a realtime firebase database and writing the data to the page through the database as well.
This results in anyone with access to the site being able to view the displayed schedules.
